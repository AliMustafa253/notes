===Introduction===

	==Client-server model ==

		- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 -- > Server
		- You only pay for what you use
		- AWS instances = click and pay for what you need
	
	==What is cloud computing?==
	
		**On Demand Delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay
		  as you go pricing.
		
		- undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT = AWS helps with it as 
			they dont differentiate companies, how you build and manage matters 
			not if you can install or how you backup as the engine is just the engine

		--Deployment Modules--
			-Cloud-based Deployment: run all parts on cloud. 
				migrate/design or build applications on cloud
				
			-On-Premises Deployment: virtualization and resource mng tools 
				aka private cloud deployment
			-Hybrid Deployment: cloud based connected with on premise infrastructure
			
		--Benefits--
			Trade upfront expense
			Maintain data centers/
			stop guessing capacity = prevent excess or limit capacity
			economies of scale = larger user base
			Inc speed and agility
			global infrastructure diff servers
			
===EC2===
	elastic compute cloud (amazon ec2)
	
	- Highly flexible
	- cost effective
	- quick		
		research and buy upfront, datacenter etc
	
	virtualization technology used for sharing hosts
	
	**Multitency: sharing resources 
			hypervsior responsible for it
		configurations choosable
			Windows/Linux
			Web apps
			Databases
			Third party softwares
			
		Launch connect use
		
	--Instance types--
		- General purpose: balanced/web servers
		- Compute Optimized: Processure/ gaming web servers
		- Memory Optimized: high performance db
		- Accelerated computing: Grapic process
		- Storage optimized: data warehousing, high read and write
		
	--EC2 pricing--
		- On demand: how much it runs for : unpredictable usage not for longer terms
		- Savings Plan: contract and consistent amount in 1 or 3 years term save upto 72% vs on demand
		- Reserved Instances: 1 or 3 partial or upfront some instances
		- Spot Instances: Can be interrupted: No contracts or commitments
			Batch instances best 2 minutres warning upto 90% discount
		- Dedicated Hosts: No sharing
		
	--Scalability And Elasticability-
		Scalability: refers to begining with only resources you need and 
			design in a way to auto respond to demand by scaling
		
		EC2 Auto Scaling: automatically add or remove ec2 instances
			- Dynamic scaling responds to demand
			- Predictive scaling right number based on prediction
			
		decoupling = allows to get exact amount of resources req
					-backend etc
					
		desired is minimum by default
		
	--Elastic Load Balancing--
		DECOUPLED ARCHITECTURE
		single point to direct to different routes
			in front end and backend both
		
		Even distribution = need a route = need a load balancer
		
		properly distribute traffic = via ELB
		
		regional construct. Automatically highly scalable
		
	---Async Communication b/w applications---
		decouple apps
		--Messaging and queuing--

		***Simple Queue Service And Notification Service

			managed service to collect,process and analyze real time streaming data at any scale
		
		---Amazon MQ---
			on premise trad apps
			
		Monolothic Architecture = tightly coupled can break down
		Microservices = loosely coupled AWS allows microservices 
		
	-Management processes-
			Serverless: cannot see or access underlying infrastructure. ez scaling
			
			AWS Lambda: Lambda function = wait for trigger and runs on an
				managed env automatically scalable
				run under 15min codes	eg resize image whn uploaded
				pay for compute time only
		
		Container: package for your code.
		Clusters = containers.
			Run containers at scales use these
		EC2 for access and underlying
		AWS no underying
		
		Docker container based ECS or EKS
		--ECS--
			Elastic Container Service= scalable supports docker
		--EKS--
			Elastic Kubernetes Service = run Kubernetes on AWS
		Ur own list or fargate
		--AWS Fargate--
			Donot need to provision or manage servers
			
==AWS global infrastructure==
	different datacenters
		high availability and fault tolerance
		Each region isolated unless you allow
		data in one region
		
	Regions according to where business is
	- Compliance with regulations ===>  legal and goverment.
	- Proximity ===> Latency
	- Feature Availability ====> regions have diff services as new hardware needed
	- Pricing ===> Brazil = more expensive
	
	Availibility zone	= mulitple zones in one region. not right next to each other
		Atleast 2 AZ	ElasticLoadBalance run in all AZ	= Regionally scoped service
	---Route 53---
		global DNS
		
	--Amazon Cloudfront--
		***content delivery service
		DDOS protection
		replicate part of ur application to edge locations 
		cache common requests
		services to customers everywhere = edge locations
			Seperate from regions = push content to edge locations
	**Aws outpost
			Hybrid Cloud
			isolated within own building. uses AWS resources so ig on premises deployment
	*EDGE LOCATIONS RUN AMAZON CLOUDFRONT Stores cached copies of your content
		closer to customers for faster delivery
		
	--AWS management console--
		Visually command 
		Test envview aws bills
		view monitoring
	
	manually doing means error possible
	--AWS CLI--

==NETWORKING==
	--Amazon Virtual Private Cloud--
		local for backend usually
		Establish boundaries in ur aws resources
	--VPC--
		Different subnets
		some internet reaching places and some only for local networks
		Public facing traffic = needs an internet gateway
		virtual private gateway Allows protected internet traffic into VPC
		
		VPC peering connect 2 vpc VPC flow log
		
		Private traffic = Virtual Private Gateway
			Still sharing resources with others so slowing possible
	--AWS direct connect--
		private dedicated private connection
		
	network hardening, application security, user identity, auth and authorization, 
	ddos prevent, data integrity, encryption
	
	--subnet--
		group resources based on security or operational needs.
		public(online store site) and private (access via db)
	
	---Network Hardening---
		VPC subnets can control packet info. checklists
		
			--Network Access control list (ACL)
				passport control officer. allow in or not and not allow in VPC.
				Stateless.
				default allow all
				
			--security group. All ports are blocked in each instance in subnet.
				multiple ec2 in subnet. Sec group = doorman, check list but wont bother out
				Stateful.
				default. allow all inbound deny allow all outbound traffic
				You can change a Security Group associated with an instance if the
				instance is in the running state.
				
			Instant stateful changing
	---AWS privateLink---

		--Amazon Cloudfront--
			CDN helps deliver edgelocations acc to geolocation.
			
		--DNS--
			Phonebook of the internet
			dns resolution is the process of translating domain name to IP
			
		--Example--
		 
		- customer requests data from the application by going to AnyCompany’s website. 
		- Amazon Route 53 uses DNS resolution to identify AnyCompany.com’s
		  corresponding IP address, 192.0.2.0. This information is sent back to the customer. 
		- The customer’s request is sent to the nearest edge location
		  through Amazon CloudFront. 
		- Amazon CloudFront connects to the Application Load Balancer,
		  which sends the incoming packet to an Amazon EC2 instance.
			
===Storage and Databases===
	--block level storage--
	store files. series of bytes which is blocks on discs.
	Hard drive.
