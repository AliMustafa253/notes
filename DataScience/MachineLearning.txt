TENSOR FLOW

	-Artificial Intelligence: A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve
			human-style intelligence. 
			There are many approaches to reaching this goal, 
			including machine learning and deep learning.
			
===:-== ----Machine Learning---- ==-:===
	Input and Output Known, rest algorithm needs to be learned.
	software has algorithm known
		
	- Feature — The input(s) to our model.
	- Labels — The output our model predicts.
	- Example — A pair of inputs/outputs used during training.
	
	- Loss function — 
		A way of measuring how far off predictions are from the desired outcome. 
		(The measured difference is called the "loss".)		mean squared error etc
		lower loss = better (closer out come values)
	
	- Optimizer function — 
		A way of adjusting internal values in order to reduce the loss.
		This optimization process is called Gradient Descent. adam optimizer
		
	- Learning Rate -
		 This is the step size taken when adjusting values in the model. If the value is too small,
		 it will take too many iterations to train the model. Too large, and accuracy goes down.
			
	- Dense Layer = Fully connected to previous layer
	
	- Weight and Biases
	
	28x28=784 pixel
	- Flattening
		2d image into vector
	
	- Activation Function -
		ReLU gives the network the ability to solve nonlinear problems. 0 for negative max(0,x)
	- Softmax
		A function that provides probabilities for each possible output class
		
	
========================

	----Test Data and Training Data----
	
	Validation dataset
	
	Regression 
		find 1 number, best result given question   For example, an estimate of a house’s value.
	
	Classification = 
		Confidence an item is of one class, output consisting of data.
		
		
========================
	----CNN----
	
	Invariance
		Recognition of image in diff positions to recognize stuff
		
	Kernel/filter
		6x6
			Kernel convolution 3x3 multiply with value selected 
			sum all of them to make corresponding value for all pixels
		
	Padding: Adding pixels of some value, usually 0, around the input image	/Downsampling
	Max Pooling
		Reduce size by summarizing regions	
			Max pooling 2x2 stride 2
			
			
	More epochs = overfitting
